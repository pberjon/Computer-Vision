# Computer Vision
 
This is a repository where I put my personal projects related to Computer Vision.

I have a bunch of Neural Networks I have implemented based of their respective papers: 
   * AlexNet
   * Gan
   * LeNet
   * ResNet

I also implemented a simple CNN from Scratch (basically from Numpy):
Results on MNIST dataset:
   * Slow: ~ 4 hours/1 epoch
   * Fast: ~ 6 min/1 epoch
   * Pytorch: ~ 1 min/1 epoch.
